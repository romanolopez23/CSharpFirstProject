# CSharpFirstProject

This is my first project in C# after taking an introductory course.

In this Console App project, I apply some of the concepts I learned from this course.

- Loops
- Logical statements
- String operations
- Number operations
- User input

Extras:
- HTTP Requests
- API
- JSON response
